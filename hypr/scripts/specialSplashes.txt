the chicken or the egg, whichever came first, it don't matter // watched the bottom of the hourglass as sand gathered
living in the fumes is not a waste, i got a higher power // ascending in a tower // sifting through the clouds, it ain't clear what isn't ours

i shoot the lights out // hide 'til it's bright out
'cause you'll never get on top of this // so mami best advice is just to get on top of this
